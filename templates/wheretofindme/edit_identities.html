  Hit the plus to add a new location, hit the minus to remove it, and drag
  and drop them to arrange them into your preferred order. The text you enter
  auto-saves when it looks like you're done entering it; to make it clear when

  If you want your links to be clickable, copy and paste in the entire
  address to your profile on another site. For some services this isn't
  possible, so you can just put in your username or other identifier and we'll
  display it.
