  Hit the plus to add a new alias, hit the minus to remove it, and drag and
  drop them to arrange them into your preferred order. They save as soon as you
  click elsewhere.

<p class="text-justify">
  Your first alias is the default, used throughout the site to identify you.
  You canâ€™t remove it, but you can change it. If you make yourself searchable,
  people can find you if they know any of your aliases. All your aliases are
  visible to anyone who looks at your profile. Anyone who follows you can
  always find you in search.
